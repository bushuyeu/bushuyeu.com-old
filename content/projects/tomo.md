description: "Often, most knowledgeable people in the organization repeat the same information to others multiple times in Slack, Jira tickets, 1-1 calls or group calls. 

Tomo is designed to help them. It collects basic info and, when a question is asked, provides a suggested answer that it believes is the most relevant to the context."
